# Overview
In most of Medical channeling centers in Sri Lanka, they use a manual system to channel
a doctor either by visiting the channeling center or giving a phone call to the center. And
there is no any chance for doctors to check how many patients he has got for a medical
session in respective channeling centers other than calling the receptionist of the
channeling centers. Most of the time their hotline numbers are hard to reach in case of
an emergency. And traditional systems have to deal with lot of paperwork and it need
more employees for the organization to run daily processes.\
